    #ram_read() should accept the address to read and return the value stored there
    #ram_write() should accept a value to write, and address to write it to

#Implement the core of the CPU's run() method
    # needs to read to memory address that's stored in register PC -> store that result in IR, the Instruction Register. This can just be a local variable in run()
    # some instructions requires up to the next bytes of data after the PC in memory
    # using ram_read(), read the bytes at pc + 1 and pc + 2 from RAM into variables operand_a and operand_b in case the instruction needs them
    # Depending on the value of the opcode, perform the actions needed for the instruction per the LS-8 spec. (if-elif)
    # the PC needs to be updated to point to the next instruction for the next iteration of the loop in run()

#Implement the HLT instruction handler to cpu.py
    # So that you can refer to it by name instead of by numeric value
    # in run() in your switch, exit the loop if a HLT instruction is encountered, regardless of whether or not there are more lines of code in the LS-8 program 
    # consider HLT similar to exit()
    # halt the CPU and exits the emulator

# Add the LDI instruction handler
    # This instruction sets a specified register to a specified value
    # load "immediate", store a value in a register, or "set this register to this value"

# Add the PRN instruction handler
    # Similar to adding LDI, but the handler is simpler
    # At this point, you can run the program and have it print 8 to console.
    # a pseudo-instruction that prints the numeric value stored in a register

#PUSH and POP (the stack)
    # so the stack is in memory (self.ram). It starts at self.ram[F3] as per the spec, and the stack pointer points to the value at the top of the stack. Since the stack is "growing down" in memory, the stack pointer is decremented every time something is added to the top. 
    # so if the stack is empty and we push two values, the stack pointer becomes F2 (pointing to the top value).
    # we initialize our stack pointer to F4 instead of F3 because at the beginning thereâ€™s nothing in it
